## Deviations:
- All UI is finished, but we are blocked by setting up the Firestore database.
- Post View Page - Need to do the backend for commenting. We have a placeholder for now that shows the comments in a fashion that is expected.
- Need a backend for storing posts, location, and user data. Had trouble setting up a Firestore database and adding items to it. Pushed out to Beta release.
- Login Page - Missing the Apple Authentication, we decided to push it back to future releases, because we can login with email right now. Held back until the end.
- Post Creation Page - Missing adding images and polls, discussions about how we should display these images and polls and if we should still have them. Pushed out to Beta release.
